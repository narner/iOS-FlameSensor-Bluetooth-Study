# iOS-FlameSensor-Bluetooth-Study

Repository for blogpost ["Integrating Arduino-Bluetooth Sensors with iOS"](https://nickarner.com/notes/integrating-arduino-bluetooth-sensors-with-ios-september-5-2017/).

Consists of Arudino sketch for reading data from a flame sensor, and transmitting the data over Bluetooth to an iOS app. The iOS app will
receive the data, and display the results in a simple UI.
